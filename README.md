## General Information
- This is a linear regression model building project.
- This project is an acdemic requirement for IIIT-PGPMLAI program.
- This project will help user to identify & quantify features which are impacting shared bike demand.
- Historical large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors. 

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Model shows that temp, Season & hum variables have strong assication with Bike demand.
- When temp value increases Bike demand increases.
- Bike demand is more in spring Season.
- High hum value lead to high Bike demand.
